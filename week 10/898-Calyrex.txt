Calyrex is an arctic hare-resemblant Legendary Pokémon sporting a large, bulbous crown-like growth on its head and the focus of The Crown Tundra story. It was once a ruler of Galar who reigned during ancient times. Calyrex is a very intelligent Pokémon who has ability to envision the events of all three phases of time: Past, Present and Future. Calyrex has two additional forms that can be taken when it mounts and "fuses" with one of the Legendary Steeds using the Reins of Unity; Ice Rider form if fused with Glastrier, and Shadow Rider form if fused with Spectrier. Calyrex is merciful, bestowing healing and blessings, and also provides the growth of crops, which is why it is also known as the King of Bountiful Harvests. Calyrex's two forms each have a signature move; Glacial Lance for Ice Rider Calyrex and Astral Barrage for Shadow Rider Calyrex. As seen in the main Crown Tundra story, should it choose to communicate with humans, Calyrex can take over one's body and use it to speak the human language.
