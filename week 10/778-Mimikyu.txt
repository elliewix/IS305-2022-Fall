Totem Pok√©mon of Acerola's Trial. Has the ability Disguise, that prevents the damage of the first attack that would hit Mimikyu before changing it to the "Busted Form". After that Disguise can't be activated again until either Mimikyu faints and is revived or the battle ends. If anyone busts its disguise, it will seek revenge on who ever did it, then cry as it mends its costume. A scholar once died after looking at whats underneath its costume.
