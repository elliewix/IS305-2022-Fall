A chimera Legendary Pokémon, Type: Null was created by Branch Chief Faba of the Aether Foundation as a means of combating Ultra Beasts; canonically, only three of these creatures were made, and called Type: Full. They contains cells from all 18 types of Pokémon and were designed to be able to shift between any of the types through the RKS System. However, they went berserk when this system was activated and were fitted with restraining devices before being placed in cryogenic stasis indefinitely, at which time they were renamed Type: Null.
