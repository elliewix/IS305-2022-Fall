The mascot for Sun, Solgaleo is a large, lion-like Pokémon that is revered as "the beast that devours the sun".[36] Solgaleo is adorned with a mane that resembles the sun itself.[36][37] Solgaleo can be fused with Necrozma to become Dusk Mane Necrozma. Its signature move (shared with Dusk Mane Necrozma) is Sunsteel Strike, and its signature Z-Move is Searing Sunraze Smash. Solgaleo is one of the summonable Pokémon in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. It is also obtainable in the Pokémon Sword and Shield Crown Tundra Expansion Pass (exclusive to Pokémon Sword), by evolving a Cosmog obtained from an old lady at a house in Freezington or during Dynamax Adventures.
