Design inspired by the Japanese y≈çkai Yuki-onna, a vengeful spirit that takes the form of a woman and traps its victims with its icy breath or within blizzards.[51] If you're inside your house, and trapped in a blizzard, be careful. When you hear a knocking at your door, always check before you answer because it might be a wild Froslass, which can surprisingly freeze you to death instantly if you're not careful.
