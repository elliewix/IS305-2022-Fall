Hitmonlee's design is based on Headless men, from Greco-Roman mythology. It may be also be based on Kabandha, a demon from Hindu Mythology. Its name is derived from actor and martial artist Bruce Lee. It will rub its legs down after fighting to overcome fatigue. It also can extend its legs to deliver power kicks. Hitmonlee and Hitmonchan didn't have a distinct evolutionary line until Tyrogue and Hitmontop were conceived. Hitmonlee evolves from Tyrogue if it has higher Attack stats.
