Duraludon are dragon-resemblant alloy Pokémon that are unusually light for their size. It seems to be based on The Shard, the tallest building in the United Kingdom. Sharing a habitat with Tyranitar, the two species frequently battle for territory. Like all Steel-type Pokémon, Duraludon are capable of being taught the immensely powerful Steel-type move Steel Beam てっていこうせん (Tettei Kо̄sen), which, while powerful, causes the user to lose half of their base HP.[25]
