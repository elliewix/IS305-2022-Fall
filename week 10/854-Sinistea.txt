Sinistea are teacup Pokémon inspired by black tea. This Pokémon is unique in that it has authentic and phony forms, emulating antique collecting. Authentic Sinisteas have a seal of authenticity on the bottom of their cup, whereas phonies do not. Authentic Sinisteas are much rarer to find than their phony counterparts.
