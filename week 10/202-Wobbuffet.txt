When you see a Wobbuffet, the blue body isn't actually its real body. The black tail that it likes to keep hidden may be the actual body. The most famous Wobbuffet is Team Rocket's Wobbuffet in the anime, who serves as comedy relief. If 2 Wobbufeet meet, it will try to outdo the others endurance in various ways. One habit trainers have to watch out for is who can go the longest without food.
