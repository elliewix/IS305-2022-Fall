Chinchou and Lanturn are based on the Footballfish.[15] Chinchou combines its positive and negative energy to attack prey. It also communicates to others by flashing its lights at them. Laturn is called "The Deep Sea Star" because of its antenna. It can illuminate its light by causing chemical reactions between bacteria and its body fluids. It is based on anglerfish.
