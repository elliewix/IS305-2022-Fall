Raikou was designed by Muneo Sait≈ç.[39] Also known as the "Embodiment of Lightning", it can run across plains at the speed of lightning. Ho-Oh resurrected it after it perished as a helpless unknown animal in a burning tower. Some say it is an electric type because it symbolizes the lightning that struck the tower.
