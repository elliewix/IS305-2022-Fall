One of the Ultra Beasts, known as UB-01 Symbiont,[38] Nihilego are parasitic life forms that inject dangerously potent mind-affecting neurotoxins into their hosts. As seen in the climax of Sun and Moon, and in one of the episodes of the Sun and Moon anime, should the need arise, they can also physically take control over their victims to feed off of them. If the Ultra Beast takes control of a Trainer, and if that Trainer possessed has a team of Pokémon, the Pokémon will be placed under Nihilego's control, indicated by an aura they emit when they are under the aforementioned Ultra Beast's control. When battled, it is impossible to defeat them because the Ultra Beast's power will revive them. According to Gladion in the anime, unless Nihilego is defeated, they will keep on battling infinitely. They appear to be made of a glass-like substance and have been seen moving like a young girl. Its home world is the Ultra Deep Sea. It is the only Rock/Poison Type Pokémon so far.
