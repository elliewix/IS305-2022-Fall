Two Legendary Pokémon of Galar appeared in a Nintendo Direct on January 9, 2020 and are new members of the Legendary Titans, alongside Regirock, Regice, Registeel and their master Regigigas. Their official names were revealed in a trailer on June 2, 2020. They appeared in The Crown Tundra story. Only one of these two Titans can be caught per game, and the one to be caught is determined by the player. Both, along with Regirock, Regice and Registeel, are required in the party to encounter Regigigas in a Pokémon Den, meaning the Titan not captured by the player must be obtained by trading.Regieleki's body is a single organ composed of a cluster of electricity, which generates electrical energy. If the rings bounding its body together were to be removed, all of its energy would be released at once. Its signature move, Thunder Cage, damages the target and traps it in a field of electricity that damages them mildly over the course of four to five turns. It has the highest base Speed stat of any Electric-type Pokémon.
Regidrago's body is made of crystallized dragon energy and is said to have the powers of all Dragon-type Pokémon. It is theorized that its arms were once the head of an ancient dragon Pokémon, but this theory remains unproven. Regidrago was created by Regigigas out of crystallized dragon energy, but ran out of crystals, and thus, only the head was completed. As a result, the people of old feared of the destruction Regidrago would cause on their land should it be completed. The ancient people immediately sealed it away in a temple. Regidrago's signature move, Dragon Energy, deals more damage the more HP it has left.
