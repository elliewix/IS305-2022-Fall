Incineroar's design is based on heel fighters and wrestlers.[14] Their waists have flames in the shape of a championship belt. They have a cold persona, but are said to love praise from young Pokémon and children.[15] The design of Incineroar also drew some inspiration from the Hawaiian wildlife.[16] The Shiny Pokémon version of Incineroar changes his color scheme to orange fur with white stripes.[17] Incineroar debuted in Pokémon Sun and Moon for the Nintendo 3DS.[18] It also appears in Nintendo's Super Smash Bros. series, appearing as the last newcomer for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.[16][19] Masahiro Sakurai, the game's director, said he chose Incineroar because he wanted a wrestling character for the game.[20] In the Japanese version of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Incineroar is voiced by Unshō Ishizuka, who also voiced Professor Oak in the Pokémon anime. It marked one of his final voice acting appearances before his 2018 death a few months before the release of the game.[21][22] Tyler Bunch provides the character voice in the English version.[23] In the Pokémon anime, Incineroar debuted in the 2017 film Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!, under the ownership of Cross.[24][25] Incineroar initially received criticism from fans before it was officially revealed as it was assumed to be a dual Fire/Fighting-type Pokémon, a strongly disliked trend among Fire-type starters. Dustin Kemp of The Inquisitr called Incineroar's eventual reveal a "brilliant trolling maneuver by GameFreak".[14] Incineroar has received mixed reviews from critics and fans. Matthew Guida of The Gamer has complimented Incineroar, calling it a "fearsome Pokémon" and particularly praised its Shiny Pokémon form, which he said "adds a majestic and regal appearance to its regular design".[17] Allegra Frank of Polygon critiqued Incineroar's design of a "gigantic fighting feline monster", compared to its pre-evolution Litten, to be "upsetting" and leaving fans "extremely disheartened", but nonetheless praised its Fire/Dark typing as "some good to be found in Incineroar’s official reveal".[26] Oliver Cragg of International Business Times was critical of Incineroar in Pokémon Sun and Moon because "its stats are spread so broadly that it fails to excel at anything", and that its attacks are "a tad underpowered".[27] Jordan Minor of Geek.com praised the addition of Incineroar to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate because its professional wrestling-inspired grapple moves are so different from those of other playable characters. He wrote: "We're excited to try out up close and personal grabs and lariats or even bouncing foes against the ropes."[16]
