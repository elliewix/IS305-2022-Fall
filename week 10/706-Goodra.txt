It is based on the Lou Carcolh, a mythical serpent/mollusk creature from French folklore. Alternatively, it could be based on the y≈çkai called Shussebora, meaning "ascended trumpet shell", which is a trumpet shell snail that lives 1000 years in the mountains, 1000 on the plains, and 1000 at sea, then will ascend and turn into a dragon.
