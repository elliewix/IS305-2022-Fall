Its vocal cords are not fully developed yet and so it hurts to use them. It can gargle fresh water from a stream to replenish them. Its body is very bouncy, so if it bounces, there's no stopping it. In the English-dubbed anime, it was voiced by Rachael Lillis, who also voiced Jigglypuff and Wigglytuff. It evolves into Jigglypuff at high enough friendship levels.
