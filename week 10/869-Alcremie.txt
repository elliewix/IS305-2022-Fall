Alcremie are based on whipped cream. They can produce whipped cream that becomes richer the happier they are. Depending on how long they are spun around as a Milcery, in which direction, at what time of day, and what Sweet they are holding, Alcremie can take dozens of different forms. The Sweets that can be embedded into it include the Strawberry, Flower, Star, Clover, Berry, Ribbon, and Heart Sweets. [22] Certain Alcremie are capable of Gigantamax and in combination with a giant cake formed in the process grow to more than 29 m (95 ft) in height. The cake is extremely resistant to attacks. They use "high-calorie cream missiles" to attack opponents.[23] Critics and fans[who?] praised Alcremie's design as cute. Writers of Eater and Time also brought attention to sexual innuendos surrounding the Pokémon's descriptions.[22][16] David Lozada of Game Revolution called Alcremie one of the weirdest Pokémon to date.[19]
