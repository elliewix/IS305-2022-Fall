Unown has 28 different forms: 26 representing each letter in the Latin alphabet, one for a question mark, and one for an exclamation mark. One alone can't do much, but when a lot come together, strange things are said to happen. Research is going on about which came first, the Unown, or the mysterious, ancient writing. However, nothing much is known about it. Unowns are legendary Pok√©mon.
