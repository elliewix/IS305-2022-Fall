When a Nincada evolves into a Ninjask and there is an extra space in the player's party, a Shedinja is created from the Nincada's shed exoskeleton.[35] People say if you look in the hole in the back of its body, your soul will be stolen. In the games, Shedinja is notable for its unique trait of having only 1 HP and for blocking all attacks except "super effective" ones with its ability Wonder Guard.
