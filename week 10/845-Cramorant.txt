Cramorant are cormorant-like Pokémon that activate their Gulping Form (or Gorging Form if below 50 percent health) after using the moves Surf or Dive. In Gulping Form, Cramorant emerges from its dive with an Arrokuda in its mouth. In Gorging Form, it emerges with a Pikachu in its mouth, face-first, kicking its legs. If any damage is dealt to Cramorant while in this state, they will counterattack by spitting a catch from their mouth. If Pikachu is spit at the opposing Pokémon, it becomes paralyzed. Its able to knock out foes with powerful attacks, but it may forget what its fighting mid-fight.
