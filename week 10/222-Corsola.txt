Mareanie (introduced in Sun & Moon) loves to eat Corsola's coral branches as a snack and it actively chases them down just for their branches. Its Galarian form is a Ghost Type. The Galarian form, being Ghost-type with a white coloration, is speculated to be a reference to coral bleaching, which is an environmental issue that marks the death of corals which has been caused by global warming.
