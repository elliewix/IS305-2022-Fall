Paras is a Bug-type that is host to a parasitic mushroom. As it ages, the mushroom begins to completely take over its body, evolving it into Parasect. Most of the nutrients Paras gets from feeding on plant roots are absorbed instead by the mushrooms. These mushrooms can be removed and used for medicines. More will grow on Paras' back later on.
