Samurott is a quadruped, sea lion-like Pok√©mon. It can silence its enemies by glaring at them and it can defeat an opponent by swinging the swords on its armor,[6] known as seamitars.[7] he decided to make the third evolution based on a sea lion, with Oshawott's shell turned into a sword. He also stated that Oshawott's evolution would be Japanese style of design. He also cited the powerful nature from them such as the "sound they made when they stamped on the ground."[8][9] Sugimori also intended to design Samurott to be a completely different shape from Oshawott that would aid in making it a "den mother" figure.[8]
