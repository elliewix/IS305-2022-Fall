Sandaconda are anaconda-like Pok√©mon with a large sand pouch on its neck. This pouch is so thick that a Durant's mandibles can't pierce through it. They expel the sand stored inside through their nostrils at high pressure, similarly to a double-barreled shotgun. When they take on a Gigantamax form, they resemble a tornado or dust devil and attack by spinning the sand around their body.
