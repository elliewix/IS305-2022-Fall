Raised under the care of Gladion, one of the escaped Type: Null broke its restraining device and was able to control its RKS System. This evolution was named Silvally by Gladion. Having full control of the RKS System, Silvally is able to change between any of the 18 types through the use of memory disks, in a similar fashion to the Mythical Pok√©mon Arceus.
