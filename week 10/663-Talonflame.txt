Talonflame can fly at speeds of 500 km/h (310 mph) while attacking prey.[38] During the Generation VI-era (2013–2016), Talonflame was one of the most-used Pokémon in competitions. It proved incredibly useful in the "hyper-offensive" Pokémon Video Game Championships and appeared on just over 41 percent of Winter 2014 teams. The entire metagame shifted in order to counter Talonflame, with most players adding dedicated strategies to taking it down. Later iterations of the game nerfed Talonflame, culminating with Sun and Moon adding multiple counters to the Pokémon.[39]
