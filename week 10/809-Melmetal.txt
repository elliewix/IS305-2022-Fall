A Mythical Pokémon who can evolve from Meltan by using 400 Meltan candies in Pokémon Go. Legends say it can make metal out of nothing and it has come back to life after 3,000 years. After its life ends, it will eventually crumble to rust. The rusty pieces will then be reborn as Meltan again. In Generation VIII, Melmetal was given a Gigantamax form, which is obtainable by performing a transfer from Pokémon Go to Pokemon Home for the first time.
