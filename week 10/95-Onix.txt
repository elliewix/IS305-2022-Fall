Though its design has been praised, critics deem Onix underpowered compared to other Rock-types of its generation. Onix is a large rock snake with a spike on its head. A large Onix appeared in the anime, where a Sandslash burrowed into its body. It evolves into Steelix when traded while holding a Metal Coat.[1][52][53][54]
