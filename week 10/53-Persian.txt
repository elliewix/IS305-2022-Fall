A Persian is owned by Team Rocket's leader, Giovanni in the Pok√©mon anime series, but can be seen in the wild throughout. Persian will sneak up behind a foe so silently by retracting its claws. It will then pounce on them and rip them to shreds. Persian has an Alola Form that is an Dark Type and its Galarian counterpart Perrserker is a Steel Type. While Meowth has a gold coin on its forehead, Persian has a red jewel.
