Rolycoly are rock and coal Pokémon that were commonplace in Galar homes up until 100 years before the events of Sword and Shield. The coal that falls off their bodies was used for cooking and heating.[18] David Lozada of Game Revolution described Rolycoly's history as "depressing", and likened their usage to slavery. He also labeled Rolycoly as one of the weirdest Pokémon to date.[19]
