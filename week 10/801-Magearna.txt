A man-made metallic Mythical Pokémon that contains an unknown secret within and has a connection to Volcanion. It was leaked on February 10, 2016, in that month's issue of CoroCoro Comic[39] and officially revealed by The Pokémon Company on February 14.[40] Its Soul-Heart is apparently what keeps it alive. Magearna was made by a scientist from a lost kingdom 500 years ago. It has an alternate form known as Original Color Magearna, which was not obtainable until the release of Pokémon Home. Magearna is the only known Pokemon capable of using the move Fleur Cannon.
