The evolution of Galarian Farfetch'd. Only the most experienced Farfetch'd in battle can evolve into Sirfetch'd. It uses its sharp leek as a weapon and for food, and retires from battle when it withers. Players must use Galarian Farfetch'd to land three critical hits in one single battle for it to evolve, even if it faints. Its leek sword and leek shield are apparently very tough.
