Zacian is a wolf-like Pokémon. In its Crowned Sword form, it carries a sword in its mouth.[2] Crowned Sword Zacian fights gracefully and its sword is capable of gracefully cutting through anything.[27] In Crowned Sword form, its signature move Behemoth Blade deals double damage to Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokémon. Its design is similar to the Great Grey Wolf Sif from Dark Souls.[2][28] Bandai Namco, the publisher for Dark Souls, acknowledged the similarity soon after the Pokémon's reveal during E3 2019.[29] In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Zacian is a spirit along with Zamazenta.
