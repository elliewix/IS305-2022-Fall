Espeon shares its category name with Sunflora and Volcarona. They are all known as the Sun Pok√©mon. Espeon is an Eeveelution that can sense where a foe is at by the wind direction with its fine, thin hairs on its body. When attacking, the red orb on its forehead glows if it is using its psychic powers. If it trusts a Trainer very closely, it will become extremely loyal to them. It is said that it developed psychic powers to keep its Trainer from dangerous harm. It is the Psychic evolution of Eevee, evolving when its friendship is high enough during the daytime.
