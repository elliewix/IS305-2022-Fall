A wyrm-like Pok√©mon, Flapple's evolution was induced by the Tart Apple that it ate. The shell of the apple it once inhabited has become armor and also serves as wing-like appendages which Flapple can use to fly. It can pull the pieces of the shell together to shield itself and spits a potent acid stored in its cheeks, capable of causing chemical burns. Its signature move is Grav Apple. It has a Gigantamax form. It appears to be based on the Lindwurm.
