Eternatus is said to have birthed from a meteor hitting Galar over 30,000 years ago. It causes the Darkest Day in the climax of the game, taking all the Dynamax power in Galar to its advantage. Unlike Gigantamaxing, this Pokémon has an exclusive "Eternamax" form, which is only seen in the game's climax and battled by the player. The only legitimately obtainable appearance of this Eternamax form is when Eternatus uses one of its signature moves, Eternabeam. It has a second signature move known as Dynamax Cannon, which deals double damage to Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokémon.
