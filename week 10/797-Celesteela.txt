One of the Ultra Beasts, known as UB-04 Blaster,[38] Celesteela are rocket-like life forms that expel a powerful gas stored within themselves for flight. According to Professor Burnet in the anime, they create the RP-1-like rocket fuel by absorbing the nutrients of nearby plants. Despite their Steel typing, they are plant-like in composition. They seem to have a resemblance to the Space Shuttle because the arms on its sides represent solid rocket boosters while the huge central section represents the External Tank. Its home world is the Ultra Crater.
