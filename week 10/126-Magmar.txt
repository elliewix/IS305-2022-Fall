While Magmar was voted the eighth best fire-type Pokémon by the Official Nintendo Magazine readers,[67] GamesRadar has criticized its design multiple times, noting that its forehead resembles a butt.[68][69] Magmar evolves from Magby and into Magmortar. It is famed for being the first Pokémon to use Fire Punch, and is one of gym leader Blaine's best Pokémon. Ash Ketchum, being the genius that he is, tried to fight this Fire-type with his own Fire-type, Charizard.
