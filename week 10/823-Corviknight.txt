Corviknight are large, raven-like Pok√©mon with steel bodies who are frequently used to taxi people around the Galar region through the transit system known as Flying Taxi. Their design draws inspiration from the legend of ravens guarding the Tower of London.[2] Certain Corviknight are capable of Gigantamax and grow to more than 14 m (46 ft) in height. The energy produced by Gigantamax Corviknight causes its steel feather to form "blade birds" that fly around the creature and can be used to attack.[10] In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Corviknight is a spirit.
