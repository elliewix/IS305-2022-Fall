A large, lumbering Pokémon, Appletun's evolution was induced by the Sweet Apple that it ate. It generates a very sweet nectar from its back, the scent of which lures bug Pokémon that it preys on. The loose patches of skin on its back are considered to be especially delicious and were once known to be peeled off and eaten as a snack by children. Its signature move is Apple Acid. It has a Gigantamax form. It appears to be based on the Lindwurm.
