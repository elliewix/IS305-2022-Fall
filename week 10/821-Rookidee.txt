Rookidee is a nimble chickadee-like Pok√©mon that is willing to challenge even the most powerful opponents; even if it loses, this only benefits it, as it still gets stronger little by little. Along with its evolution Corvisquire, are the first ever regional birds to be pure Flying-type and the 2nd and 3rd Pokemon to be pure flying type after Tornadus.
