It likes to throw things with its massive horns. It can throw things 2x its weight. It was originally supposed to have an evolution called "Plux" in Generation II. Some speculated this unused design was reworked into Heracross. Pinsir appears as a tan-borwn bug, similar in a appearance to an earwig with its pinchers on its head, and a virtacle slit like mouth. It has a Mega Evolution thats even stronger.
