Under immense pressure underground, an Onix is said to have its rock-like body compressed into diamonds and evolve into Steelix. In a paper published by the University of Leicester, physicists calculated the plausibility of Onix evolving into Steelix through the stated lore. It would require pressures of 4.5–6 gigapascals at a temperature of 900 to 1,300 °C (1,650 to 2,370 °F) over a period of billions of years for this conversion to take place. Assuming these conditions, the resulting Steelix would be substantially smaller than given in the Pokédex entry and is considered implausible.[35] It lives even further down than Onix toward the earth's core. There are records of it reaching over 6/10 of a mile down underground. Steelix evolves after being traded while holding a Metal Coat.
