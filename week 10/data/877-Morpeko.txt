Morpeko are rodent Pok√©mon seemingly based on hamsters and guinea pigs. They have electric abilities; the electricity that they generate causes them to become hungry. When they get extremely hungry, they also become violent. Morpeko's signature move Aura Wheel changes type depending on whether it is in Full Belly Mode (Electric) or Hangry Mode (Dark). In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Morpeko is a spirit.
