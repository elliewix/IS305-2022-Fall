Drednaw - resemblant of the alligator snapping turtle, is a slow species of Pok√©mon, but are known for their immense biting power. They are particularly stubborn and hard to raise, resulting in inexperienced trainers releasing them after capture.[2] Certain Drednaw are capable of Gigantamax and grow to more than 24 m (79 ft) in height. Becoming bipedal in the process, Gigantamax Drednaw use their massive bodies to crush opponents. By rapidly extending its neck, they can punch holes in large metal structures and mountains.[13]
