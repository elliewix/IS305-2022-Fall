Kadabra has been the source of various controversies. The symbols on its body have been associated to those used by Nazi Germany's Waffen-SS. Furthermore, in November 2000, Israeli magician Uri Gellar sued Nintendo, claiming Kadabra embodies an unauthorized appropriation of his identity.[29][30][31] However, in 2020, he releases a claim that Nintendo can use Kadabra again.
