Shellder's poison going through Slowking's head makes it very smart, it researches the mysteries of life every day, however nobody knows what its saying. If, somehow, Shellder were to detach from its head, not only would it de-evolve back into a Slowpoke, but it would forget everything it learned when it was a Slowking. Its Galarian form is a Poison/Psychic Type. It evolved from Slowpoke after being traded while holding a King's Rock.
