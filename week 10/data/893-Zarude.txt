Zarude is a new Mythical Pokémon that was revealed on Pokémon Day 2020. Resemblant of a baboon and a mandrill, Zarude is very aggressive and lives in packs. When the vines on their body tear off, they become nutrients for the soil and stimulate the growth of the plants in the lush forests it calls home[30] However, they also occasionally exhibit a softer side. One of the Zarude, a caped one, left its pack to care for an orphaned human child. From its bond with this human child, it developed unique strength. As a result, it was nicknamed Dada.[31] This Pokémon will also star in the upcoming 23rd anime film, Pokémon the Movie: Secrets of the Jungle, releasing in Japan on December 25, 2020.[32] Zarude is the only Pokemon capable of learning the move Jungle Healing. Jungle Healing restores HP and heals the status conditions of Zarude and its allies.
