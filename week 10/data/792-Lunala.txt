The mascot for Moon, Lunala is a large, bat-like Pokémon that is revered as "the beast that calls the moon".[36] When its wings are spread wide, Lunala resembles a night sky and crescent moon.[36][37] Lunala can be fused with Necrozma to become Dawn Wings Necrozma. Its signature move (shared with Dawn Wings Necrozma) is Moongeist Beam, and its signature Z-Move is Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom. Lunala is one of the summonable Pokémon in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Like Solgaleo, it is also obtainable in the Pokémon Sword and Shield Crown Tundra Expansion Pass (exclusive to Pokémon Shield), by evolving a Cosmog obtained from an old lady at a house in Freezington or during Dynamax Adventures.
