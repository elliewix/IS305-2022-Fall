Four new fossil Pokémon were introduced in Sword and Shield, seemingly based on the Crystal Palace Dinosaurs, a collection of misassembled dinosaur sculptures on display in London's Crystal Palace Park. Each come from various combinations of four fossils: Bird, Dino, Drake and Fish. If you resurrect two fossils, the outcome will be one of these Pokémon. The Fozzilized Bird and Fossilized Dino items are more common in Sword. and the Fossilized Fish and Fossilized Drake items are more common in Shield.Dracozolt was almost unbeatable in its time thanks to its powerful strong legs in its lower half of its body, while the top was entirely too small in size and while it can generate electricity in the muscles in its tail, its depletion of its plant-food resources caused its own extinction.
The shaking upper half of Arctozolts body is what generates electricity. It also could preserve food in the ice on its body to save for a later time if it was hungry. The reason why it went extinct in the first place was because it found itself too slow and it had a hard time moving around.
Dracovish's powerful jaws and legs made it the most fearless predator of its time, but its own doing made it extinct by over hunting it's underwater prey. Although it can run up to 40 mph, it can't breathe unless it's underwater. It is very popular in competitive Pokémon due to its signature move, Fishious Rend and its statistics compared to the other fossils.[24]
The skin on Arctovish's face is completely immune to attacks and while freezing its surroundings is how it hunts prey, it can have a hard time eating it due to the mouth on the top of its head. It couldn't breathe very well, leading to its extinction.
