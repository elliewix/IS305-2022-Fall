Originally, Umbreon was a Poison-type Pokémon before they made it a Dark-type. Before the next generation of Pokémon was released, Umbreon was the only pure Dark-type Pokémon, making it the only Eeveelution that ever had a unique type combination. It evolved due to exposure of the moon's rays. The rings on its body will glow when hunting and make anyone watching have chills down their spines. It is the Dark-type evolution of Eevee, evolving at night at high friendship levels. It has poisonous sweat.
