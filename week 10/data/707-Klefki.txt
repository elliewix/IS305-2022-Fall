Klefki was designed by Pokémon graphic designer Mana Ibe and inspired by "old mansions and secret keys".[59] It may also be at least partially inspired by the Japanese yōkai Tsukumogami, household objects that gain souls.[55] Video game journalists regarded its design as among the worst of new Pokémon introduced in X and Y,[55][60] and characterized the design as uninspired, insipid, strange, and an example of Game Freak's "creative bankruptcy".[61][62][63] It has also been regarded as one of the worst Pokémon in general.[64][65][66][67] IGN readers voted Klefki as the ninth-worst Pokémon from Pokémon X and Y with Justin Davis joking that it was created when a designer lost his keys.[68] VentureBeat called it "ugly," stating that it was no surprise that they made a Pokémon based on keys due to running out of ideas.[69] GameRevolution, The Daily Telegraph, and The Huffington Post considered Klefki as one of the weirdest Pokémon ever, while Chris Davidson of Comic Book Resources listed Klefki as the most questionable Pokémon design.[70][71][72][73] Hayes Madsen of Screen Rant claimed that Klefki should never have been made, noting derisively that it is a Pokémon based on an inanimate object.[74] Kassandra Khaw of USGamer expressed annoyance that Klefki was so useful in competitive Pokémon play due to how "sloppily designed" she found it to be.[75]GameRevolution claimed that Klefki is their favorite Pokémon, despite the criticism it's received.[76] The A.V. Club stated that they found Klefki's simplicity amusing.[77] Chris Plante of Polygon counted Klefki among their favorite Pokémon, alongside Pikachu and Squirtle.[78] Kyle Hilliard of GameInformer claimed that Klefki is his favorite Pokémon in Pokémon Sun and Moon, but described it as the weirdest Pokémon ever.[79][80] Mike Minotti for VentureBeat claimed that Klefki is so stupid that it made it awesome.[81] Kotaku's Patricia Hernandez noted that while players who dislike "inanimate objects that are somehow Pokémon," she had to defend it due to its basis on the Japanese mythological tsukumogami and its "ridiculous" design.[82] The Rochester City Newspaper's Willie Clark felt that it was "awesome."[83]
