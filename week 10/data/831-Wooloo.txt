Wooloo are peaceful, sheep-like Pok√©mon whose wool is used in certain Galar towns to create goods. When faced with combat, they tend to simply roll away. Their simple design originates from the abundance of sheep across the United Kingdom.[2] Wooloo proved popular with fans, with many of them creating fan art of it. Michael McWhertor of Polygon described Wooloo as "perfect in every way", while game director Shigeru Ohmori said that "it definitely caught [him] by surprise just how popular it became".[11][12]
