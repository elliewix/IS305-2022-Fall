Hypno is based on the dream-eating tapir, Baku and a hypnotist. It polishes its pendulum to more effectively put people to sleep. Try not to look at it. There is a myth within the franchise that Hypno preys on human children. This has led to Hypno becoming the subject of creepypastas. Hypno is purely yellow with a white fluffy collar mane.
