Jynx has spawned controversy due to aspects of its design being similar to blackface, leading Game Freak to change the color of its skin from black to purple.[62][63][64][65][66] When Pok√©mon Yellow was re-released on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console, the in-game sprite of Jynx was edited to reflect this change.[66] Jynx's appearance is a purple humanoid with blond hair and a dress. It has big lips that it uses to confuse opponents by kissing them. It evolves from Smoochum.
