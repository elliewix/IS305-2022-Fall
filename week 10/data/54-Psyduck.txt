When Psyduck's headache gets severe, it unleashes its psychic powers. Psyduck was originally intended to have a currently unnamed middle evolution, but it was scrapped. It was also originally called "Ducky" in early development. Psyduck in the anime series first appears belonging to Misty, and usually seems to be unreliable and a nuisance until it begins using its Psychic abilities.
