Slowpoke eats by dipping its tail in the water. Slowpoke tails are quite a delicacy. Its Galarian form is a Psychic Type. Slowpokes typically appear to be lazy and dumb, but are quite formidable. It is said to evolve into Slowbro when a Shellder attaches itself to its tail. Trading Slowpoke while it holds a King's Rock evolves it into Slowking.
