Arceus changes its type when it is holding either a colored plate or a Z-Crystal of the type its wants. Like Darkrai and Shaymin before it, Arceus was not officially revealed by Nintendo until February 14, 2009, the year of its debut movie. It was officially revealed to international audiences on August 3, 2009. Arceus is known as "The Original One", as it is said that it created Sinnoh and possibly created the entire Pokémon universe, along with the Lake Guardians, the Creation Trio and Legendary Titans along with Regigigas with its said 1,000 arms. It can change types if it holds a Plate that corresponds to the intended type. It is set to appear in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, where it will take a central role. It is the only Pokemon that can learn the move Judgement.
