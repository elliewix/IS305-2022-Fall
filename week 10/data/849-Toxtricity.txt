Toxtricity resembles a reptile or amphibian. There are two forms of Toxtricity based on the nature of the Toxel it evolves from; Low Key Form and Amped Form. The protruding organs on its belly can be clawed at to generate electricity and depending on the form, emanates sounds resemblant of an electric guitar or a bass guitar. A Gigantamax form was introduced in a Wild Area update on February 6, 2020. Raids for Amped Form Toxtricity Gigantamax appear natively in Sword, and raids for Low Key Form Toxtricity appear natively in Shield. For a limited time upon release, the appearances of these Gigantamax forms were more common in Max Raid Battles. The appearance stays the same for the two forms when Gigantamaxed.
