Its destructive nature has further ascended thanks to Mega Evolution energy, placing a burden on it only adding to its rage. Now its native instinct is to destroy everything it sees using power jets of water coming from the red orifices on its sides.

However, it will listen to a Trainer it really trusts if it isn't obeying its destructive drive.
