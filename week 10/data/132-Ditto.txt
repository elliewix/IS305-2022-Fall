The favorite Pokémon of Hideo Kojima,[70] Ditto is capable of transforming into any Pokémon it comes across. It was originally intended to have an evolution in Generation II, called "Animon", which it would have evolved from a Metal Coat. Fan speculation is that Ditto and Mew are related as Mew can also use Transform, a move exclusive to Ditto. In the anime, Ditto belonging to Duplica had an issue with accurately mimicking appearances where its face always looked like Ditto's own. It appears as a pink blob or amoeba.
