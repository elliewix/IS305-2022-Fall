The Grass-type starter in Pokémon Sword and Shield. Grookey is a mischievous and curious monkey-like Pokémon.[5] It carries a special stick from the forests where its species live. Using energy from the sun transferred through Grookey, this stick can revitalize plants in the area where Grookey uses it as a drumstick.[6] In a poll held by The Pokémon Company International's official Twitter account, Grookey was the least popular of the three starters, receiving only 25% of the vote.[7] In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Grookey is a spirit along with Sobble and Scorbunny.
