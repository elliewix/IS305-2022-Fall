Deoxys is capable of changing between four "forms"—Normal, Attack, Defense and Speed—each of which differs by base stat values, effort value yield and appearance.[58] In the Game Boy Advance games, Deoxys' forme changes depending on the game it is used in; subsequent games allow players to freely select each form by interacting with meteorites found in specific in-game locations. Deoxys is an alien that was born when a crystal had been hit with UV rays.In March 2005, NASA teamed up with the Pokémon Trading Card Game team to use Deoxys's likeness to educate children about outer space and the ozone layer. As part of this endeavor, NASA created browser games on its website and Nintendo of America distributed promotional bracelets and postcards.[59]
