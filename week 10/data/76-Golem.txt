Golem is known for rolling down from mountains. To prevent them from rolling into the homes of people downhill, grooves have been dug into the sides of mountains to serve as guideways for diverting this Pok√©mon's course. Golem has an Alola Form that is an Rock/Electric Type. It appears as a large boulder with a head, arms, and legs. It can roll up into a perfectly round rock. The Alolan versions are magnetic.
