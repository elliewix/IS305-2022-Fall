One of the Ultra Beasts, known as UB Adhesive, introduced in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. Poipole are alien-like Pokémon capable of understanding human feelings. It is the only Ultra Beast to evolve and apparently, it is the starter Pokémon in its world. It also cackles wildly as it sprays a very adhesive poison out of its needles on its head. In its home dimension, the Ultra Megalopolis, they are popular enough within the city's residents to be treated as starter Pokémon.
