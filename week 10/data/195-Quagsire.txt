If Quagsire gets hurt in any way, it won't feel a thing because its intelligence isn't the best. To hunt, it will just sit there in the water for food to just wander in unaware. It doesn't move much so it doesn't get hungry as often. It has a similar appearance to Wooper, except it has a more normal looking body, with arms and feet, and a tail.
