Vivillon's wings feature 18 different patterns that are dependent upon the player's real-world location (determined by their user settings on the Nintendo 3DS).[43] A special Poké Ball pattern Vivillon was released at the Pokémon Center in Paris on June 4, 2014,[44] and then worldwide on August 6, 2014, in commemoration of the launch of the franchise's online store.[45] The 20th pattern was released on July 7, 2014, as a commemoration for 100 million trades through the game's Global Trade System (GTS).[46]
