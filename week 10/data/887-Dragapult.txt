According to its Pokedex entry, Dragapult keeps its pre-evolved counterpart, Dreepy, inside of hollow openings in the front of its horns, which can be fired out like supersonic missiles. This is Dragapult's signature attack, known as Dragon Darts[26] Dragapult may be based on supersonic jets. It is also the ninth pseudo-legendary Pok√©mon in the series.
