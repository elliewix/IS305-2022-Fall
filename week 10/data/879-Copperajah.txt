Copperajah is based on the Indian elephant. Their skin is resistant to water and use their large, strong trunks to dig through rock and stone. The Pokedex entry says it came to Galar from another region, implying that it originates from a Pokémon region that hasn't been discovered yet, possible a Pokémon region based on India.
