Thundurus' "Incarnate Forme" is inspired by the Japanese Raijin, the Shinto God of lightning, thunder and storms. Its "Therian Forme" stems from the Four Symbols of Chinese myth, specifically the Azure Dragon. It is capable of transforming between forms via an item called the "Reveal Glass".[13][15]
