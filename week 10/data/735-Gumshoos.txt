The fur on Gumshoos's head has been said to bear a striking similarity to that of former U.S. President Donald Trump. However, in an interview with Game Informer, director Junichi Masuda stated that Gumshoos was designed "a long time back, and we didn’t have any intention to make it look like Donald Trump". He did acknowledge the similarities, however.[31]Gumshoos is also a Totem Pokémon on Ilima's Trial in Sun and Ultra Sun.
