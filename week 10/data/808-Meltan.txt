A Mythical Pokémon that appeared in Pokémon Go. Its appearance was initially teased as a transformed Ditto after the Pokémon Go Community Day in September 2018. When a Pokémon is transferred from Pokémon Go to a copy of Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! or Let's Go, Eevee!, the player of the Pokémon Go game is awarded a Mystery Box item, which when opened causes Meltan to appear in the wild.[5] Its name was revealed in a trailer on Pokémon's official YouTube page. It evolves into Melmetal in Pokémon Go only.[5] It can melt metal into its own molten metal-like body. Ash managed to obtain one in the anime. It later evolved into Melmetal. Circulating metal is how it gets its energy.
