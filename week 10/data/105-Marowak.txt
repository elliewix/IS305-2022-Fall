Marowak has an Alola Form that is a Ghost/Fire type. It was originally intended for Marowak to have a currently unnamed evolution, but it was scrapped. Marowak appears as an older Cubone with the skull becoming the head. It wields a bone that it uses as a boomerang. This is the only Pok√©mon that can use the Bonemurang attack. The Alolan form is darker.
