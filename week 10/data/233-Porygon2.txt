For the purposes of planetary development, Porygon was updated with the most up-to-date technology available. It evolves by holding an Up-grade. It never made any appearances in the anime after the events of "Denno Senshi Porygon", with the exception of a very brief cameo in the intro scene of the fifteenth movie, Kyurem vs. the Sword of Justice. It is the only Pokémon with a number in its name and one of only 2 Pokémon (outside of Generation VIII) that never appeared in the anime, the other being Porygon-Z.
