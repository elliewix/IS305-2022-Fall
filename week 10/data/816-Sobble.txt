Sobble are timid, chameleon-like Pokémon that can blend into their surroundings when exposed to water.[5][9] Sobble frequently start crying, which causes those around it to start crying in return, in order to distract opponents and escape conflict; its tears are said to be as potent as 100 onions.[9] In a Twitter poll held by The Pokémon Company on the three starters, Sobble was the most popular, receiving 38% of the vote.[7] In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Sobble is a spirit along with Grookey and Scorbunny.
