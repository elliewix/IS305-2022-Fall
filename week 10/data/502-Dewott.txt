Dewott's appearance is somewhat similar to Oshawott except that it is primarily light blue in coloration, has white whiskers and has a blue adornment with two scalchops around its waist. Like Oshawott, these can be detached and used as weapons. With rigorous training, Dewott acquires the ability to perform two-shell attacks with flowing swordsmanship.[5] Unlike its pre-evolutions. Dewott was also the last of the second form of the starters to be designed. In an interview with Ken Sugimori, he stated that they were concerned on what to make Oshawott evolve into after watching sea otters at a zoo.
