Tour guides always say not to go up to any flower in the jungle, no matter how beautiful is because of this reason: it might just be a Vileplume which can spread toxic spores that will leave you sick for days. Vileplume is based on the Rafflesia, the world's smelliest flower. Vileplumes are only obtainable by using the Leaf Stone.
