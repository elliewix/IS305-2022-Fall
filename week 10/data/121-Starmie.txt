Starmie, known as the Mysterious Pokémon, resembles a sea star. Starmie appears to have a second star growing on its back, which is semi-attached, being able to spin 360°. Starmie has a red jewel core, which resembles a cut precious stone and seems to shine with the seven colors of the rainbow when looked at from different angles,[57] but usually shows up red more than any other color. It can also emit electrical waves from the core that are powerful enough to reach the furthest parts of the universe.[58] The appearance of Starmie is two purple starfish connected back to back with only one having the gemstone on it.
