Clefairy evolves into Clefable when coming contact with a moon stone. Rarely seen by people, Clefable walks around on moonlit nights, skipping lightly as if in flight, allowing it to walk on water. It has an extremely sharp sense of hearing; its sensitive ears allow it to detect the dropping of a pin a mile away.
