Zygarde's design is inspired by the Níðhöggr of Norse mythology, a dragon that eats away at the roots of the world tree, Yggdrasil.[5] Zygarde normally appears as two blob-like Zygarde Cores, which individually absorb the immobile Zygarde Cells to assume the dog-like 10% Power or base 50% Power form. But the two Zygarde Cores can also combine together with every Zygarde Cell to assume their humanoid Perfect or Complete form.[29][86] Its signature move in this form (and its other forms) is Core Enforcer. The seventh generation also gave Zygarde three other signature moves: Thousand Arrows, Land's Wrath, and Thousand Waves.
