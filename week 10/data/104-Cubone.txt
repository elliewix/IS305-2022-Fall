The stains on its skull are caused by the tears it sheds knowing it will never see its mother again. The Cubone appears as a small dinosaur like Pok√©mon with a skull over its head. The skull is said to be its mother's. Despite this belief, no one has ever seen under its mask. There is speculation that Cubone and Marowak were once going to be part of the Kangaskhan line due to the similar appearance of the babies to Cubone.
