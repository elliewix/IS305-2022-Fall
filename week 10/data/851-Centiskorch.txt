Centiskorch are centipede-like Pokémon with a set of heat organs on its belly. They produce fire while doing this, in which fire makes up their antennae and rear end. When Centiskorch take on a Gigantamax form, they gain more legs and their fire becomes more powerful. Both Centiskorch and its Gigatamax form are inspired by the Ōmukade, a giant centipede yokai in Japanese mythology.
