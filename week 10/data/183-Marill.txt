GameSpot's Frank Provo and Kotaku's Patricia Hernandez have described Marill as "cute".[26][27] If you see a small, blue ball in the water, that's Marill's oil-filled tail acting as a life saver so that it can catch and eat aquatic plants. Marill appears as a sea blue mouse that is round like a ball with a zig-zag tail ending in a blue orb. The blue orb at the end of its tail can light up.
