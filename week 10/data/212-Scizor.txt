Scizor's body is as hard as steel. It is not bothered by light attacks. It uses its wings to fly and to cool down. It appears like a red, sleeker version of Scyther, except its arms are now clamps instead of blades. Scizor plays a role in the Pokémon 4 Ever movie as one of the Iron Masked Maurader's corrupted Pokémon, along with Tyranitar.
