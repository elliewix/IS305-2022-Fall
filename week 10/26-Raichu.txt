Raichu has an Alola Form that is an Electric/Psychic Type. It was originally intended for Raichu to have an evolution named Gorochu, but it was scrapped due to balance issues. Raichu was a centerpoint of a conflict during the anime for Ash Ketchum, who fought against Lt. Surge's Raichu with his own Pikachu, which made him think about evolving his Pikachu to match Surge's own.
