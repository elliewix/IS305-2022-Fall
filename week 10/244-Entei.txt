Entei was designed by Muneo Sait≈ç.[39] Legend says that every time an Entei barks or roars, a volcano is said to erupt somewhere around the world. Ho-Oh resurrected it after it perished as a helpless unknown animal in a burning tower. Some say it is a fire type because it symbolizes the fire that burnt down the building.
