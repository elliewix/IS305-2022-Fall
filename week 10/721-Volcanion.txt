A unique dual Fire- and Water-type Pokémon, Volcanion are able to create scalding steam within their body and expel it with enough force to destroy mountains.[96] Volcanion is the only Pokemon capable of using the move Steam Eruption, which immerses the target in superheated steam, and can burn the target. A Mythical Pokémon, Volcanion is not readily found in-game and is only available through Nintendo distributions. It was originally discovered by hackers on October 26, 2013,[88] and not officially revealed by Game Freak until December 14, 2015.[96]
