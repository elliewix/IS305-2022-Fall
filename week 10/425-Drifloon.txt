Designed by Shigeki Morimoto and first introduced in Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, Drifloon is a ghost-type Pokémon that has been known to carry little children off with it, but disliked heavy children. It was claimed that when a child mistaken it as a balloon, they will mysteriously disappear.Some video game journalists regarded its design as insipid and strange, while others considered Drifloon as one of the weirdest or disturbing Pokémon ever.[22][23][24][25][26][27][28]
There has been some commentary on Drifloon's backstory and origins, with critics labelling it as "horrifying,"[29] "odd piece of lore,"[30] "creepy,"[31] "one messed up pocket monster,"[32] and even "the ultimate predator."[33] Gizmodo described Drifloon as of the ghost-type species that murders unsuspecting humans to drain their life force.[34] Gita Jackson of Kotaku stated that "In cultures all across the world, a common way for people to show their respects to children who have died is to release balloons", when "It is said that children who tug on the hands of Drifloon, mistaking it for a balloon will mysteriously disappear."[26] Steven Bogos of The Escapist listed Drifloon as his favorite Pokémon, stating that "Drifloon is a God-damn balloon. Some people would call it one of the worst Pokemon designs, but those people have obviously never kicked the crap out of the elite four with a balloon."[35] Andrew Webster of The Verge claimed that Drifloon is the best Pokémon of all time, stating "Drifloon is a classic example of how deceptive appearances can be."[36]
