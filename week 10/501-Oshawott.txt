Oshawott is known as the Sea Otter Pok√©mon. The shell on its belly, known as a scalchop, is made of the same components as fingernails. Strangely, the scalchop has been known to grow from Oshawott's navel.[2] It can detach the scalchop from its body and use it as a blade.[3] It fights using the scalchop as a blade, and can block and attack the foe back in an instant.[4] Oshawott was designed to be the "cute" one of them as well as acting as a "den mother figure" to the other two.
