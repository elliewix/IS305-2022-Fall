Belonged to Jessie, a member of Team Rocket, for the Kanto, Johto, and a small portion of the Advanced Generation series of the Pok√©mon anime. The pattern on its chest is different everywhere. It is hard to escape from its coil because its muscles are so strong, it can crush a steel drum by constricting it. Even though its name is Arbok, what it pronounces is "Char-bok". Its name backwards is kobra, which is pronounced the same as cobra. In the beta for Red and Blue, its name was "Nagaasp".
