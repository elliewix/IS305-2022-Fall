Eiscue are penguin-like Pok√©mon that cover their face in an ice cube "mask" to protect their heads. They produce freezing air to keep their heads cold, as they are sensitive to heat. They fish for food with the long single hair on their head. Eiscue changes from the bulky "Ice Face" to the faster "Noice Face" when hit by a physical attack, and can change back once per battle when Hail is active. Exclusive to Shield.
