Sunkern formerly had the lowest total stats of any Pokémon.[28] However, solo form Wishiwashi[29] (introduced in Sun & Moon) currently has the lowest total stats of any Pokémon. It tries not to move because it is storing nutrients for evolution. The only thing it will eat is the morning dew. Evolves into Sunflora when exposed to a Sun Stone.
