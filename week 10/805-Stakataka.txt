One of the Ultra Beasts, known as UB Assembly, introduced in Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon. Exclusive to Ultra Moon. Stakataka are wall-like Pokémon which consist of many lifeforms. Its many eyes turn red when it's angry. When stone walls started to move, this Ultra Beast was found. It is said to be made up of approximately 150 life forms. If someone or something is on top, it will try everything it can to shake it off. If someone manages to ride it out like in a rodeo, just like Ash Ketchum did in the anime, Stakataka will stop and calm down.
