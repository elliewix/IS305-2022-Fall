The evolution of Galarian Mr. Mime. Its design appears to be inspired by The Tramp, Charlie Chaplin's famous silent film character. When Mr. Rime dances, it waves its cane of ice in time with its movements. It can attack using psychic powers which it emanates from the pattern on its belly. The pattern, which resembles a face, tends to be more expressive than Mr. Rimeâ€™s actual face. Mime Jr. look up to Mr. Rime and attempt to imitate their tap dancing steps, which possibly influences their evolution into Galarian Mr. Mime.
