Mascot of the Pokémon franchise, as well as Pokémon Yellow and Let's Go, Pikachu! Also playable in every Super Smash Bros. game to date. Gigantamax Pikachu looks like its old sprite from Red and Blue with a glowing whitish tail. It raises its tail to check its surroundings and it sometimes gets struck by lightning in that pose. If Pikachu sees something new, it'll shock it with electricity. When you see blackened marks on the ground, Pikachu mistook its electrical power.
