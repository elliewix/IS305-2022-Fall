Landorus' "Incarnate Forme" is inspired by the Japanese Inari ÅŒkami, the Shinto God of agriculture and fertility. Its "Therian Forme" stems from the Four Symbols of Chinese myth, specifically the White Tiger. It is capable of transforming between forms via an item called the "Reveal Glass".[13][15]
