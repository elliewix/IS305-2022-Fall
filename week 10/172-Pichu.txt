Pichu has become Masuda's favorite Pokémon because of the "well thought out" design process that went into creating it.[17][18][19] It is voiced by Satomi Kōrogi. It doesn't know how to control its electricity yet so it gets startled and hurt from using it and usually cries. Although, it can charge up electricity on days with thunder clouds and dry air. It touches tails with others as a test of courage. In the anime, a pair of Pichus are known as the Pichu Bros, and have appeared in their own shorts.
