Design inspired by the Japanese y≈çkai Futakuchi-onna, a woman said to have a second mouth on the back of her head in a cautionary tale about extreme dieting.[29] Its "second mouth" on the back of its head is actually two steel horns fused together. It will lure foes or prey in with its docile looking face, then use its massive jaws to bite and eat them.
