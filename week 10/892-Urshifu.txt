Kubfu evolves into Urshifu after completing its training in the Tower of Darkness or Tower of Waters and then being shown the scroll at the top floor of the respective tower. Its secondary type depends on its fighting style, with Dark for Single-Strike Style and Water for Rapid-Strike Style. Single-Strike Style Urshifu uses single, devastating blows with its fists, while Rapid-Strike Style Urshifu uses multiple, nonstop blows at unbelievable speed. Urshifu is capable of Gigantamax, with its 2 forms having different Gigantamax appearances. Each form also has a special new move - Wicked Blow for Single-Strike Style and Surging Strikes for Rapid-Strike Style. Both forms also have their own special G-Max move.
