Applin is a small inchworm-like Pokémon that takes shelter in a cored apple its whole life. Its Dragon typing and worm-like body may be inspired by wyrms. It evolves into Flapple or Appletun depending on the item it is given. Tart Apples, only found in Pokémon Sword, evolve Applin into Flapple and Sweet Apples, found exclusively in Pokémon Shield, evolve it into Appletun. It appears to be based on the Lindwurm.
