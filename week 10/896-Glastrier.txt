Described as the Legendary Steeds, they are Calyrex' loyal Pok√©mon. Depending on whether you use the Iceroot Carrots or the Shaderoot Carrots to summon a Steed, they will be the Steed that Calyrex chooses. Calyrex can mount either one and "fuse" with the Steed using the Reins of Unity to become Ice Rider Calyrex or Shadow Rider Calyrex. Only one Steed can be chosen per game.Glastrier resembles an ice-elemental unicorn with a mask of ice harder than diamond. It may be based on the horse of Conquest from the mythological Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as well as the white knight piece in chess. It emits intensely cold energy from its hooves and has massive physical strength, which it uses to belligerently take whatever it wants. To choose this Steed, the player must plant Carrot Seeds in an icy field on Snowslide Slope to grow an Iceroot Carrot.
Spectrier resembles a ghostly horse and may be based on the horse of Famine from the mythological Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as well as the black knight piece in chess. It craves silence and solitude and probes its surroundings using every sense except sight. Spectrier absorbs the life force of sleeping creatures as it runs about at night, and its kicks are said to result in out-of-body experiences. To choose this Steed, the player must plant Carrot Seeds in a gloomy field within the Old Cemetery to grow a Shaderoot Carrot.
