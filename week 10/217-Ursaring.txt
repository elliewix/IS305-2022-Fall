Instead of living off eating honey like Teddiursa did, it actually goes out to find berries and food for itself. If anyone dares to go into its territory, it will chase them out at all costs. It appears a large grizzly or brown bear like Pok√©mon. Its name is based on the Ursa constellation, and the typical scientific name for bears.
