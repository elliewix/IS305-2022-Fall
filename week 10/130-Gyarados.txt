In the beta versions for Pokémon Red and Blue, Gyarados was originally named "Skullkraken". Gyarados is inspired by the myth of a carp jumping over the Dragon Gate. Its vicious and raging attitude can decimate cities. It originally had a completely different, more lamprey-like design in Red and Green's early development. It is known to be a hard Pokémon to raise by inexperienced trainers. The shiny version is red, and plays a role in the series. It appears normally as a long blue sea dragon, despite not being Dragon-type. It is also the only Flying type that doesn't fly but it can hover.
