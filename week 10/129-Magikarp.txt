Magikarp holds the distinction of being mostly useless in the games, until it evolves into the superior Gyarados. Magikarp is based on the common carp.[56] Despite its uselessness, some players like to raise their Magikarps up to level 100 just for fun. At level 20, if not evolved, Magikarp learns Tackle. Until then, it only knows Splash and cannot be taught any TMs or HMs.
