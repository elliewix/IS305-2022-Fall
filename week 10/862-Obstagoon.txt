The evolution of Galarian Linoone, the first known Pokémon to be evolved exclusively from their pre-evolved forms' regional counterparts. Galarian Linoone evolved into this Pokémon as a result of their survival instincts. It is the only Pokémon that can learn the move Obstruct. Obstagoon's design seems to be based on glam rock; notable traits such as its long tongue and star pattern over its right eye bear a strong resemblance to Gene Simmons from the American rock band Kiss. Simmons acknowledged the resemblance and called it "flattering". Its design also seems to take inspiration from another singer - the late David Bowie (specifically his persona Ziggy Stardust). Bowie was a native of the United Kingdom, which coincides with the Galar Region being based on the UK. [21]
