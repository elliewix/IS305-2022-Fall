Owing to its simplistic yet appealing design, Gengar is Ken Sugimori's favorite Pokémon as of the release of X and Y. Gengar, and its predecessors, are considered to be rivals of the Abra evolution line. During the early life of generation 1, Gastly, Haunter, and Gengar did not have the Poison type attribute, and was considered overpowered versus most Pokémon. To remedy this, the Poison part of its dual-type was added, thus making it the rival of Abra as Ghost beats Psychic and Psychic beats Poison. Gengar itself appears as a shadow with a face, legs, arms, and several spikes. Its appearance is strikingly similar to Clefable, making some fans believe that Gengars live in Clefable's shadow.[36] Others associate it with ded Clefables.[37] Fans also reacted positively when Ash Ketchum caught a Gengar in the anime.[38]Gengar has become one of the most iconic Ghost-Type Pokémon of the franchise.[39][40] Official Nintendo Magazine named Gengar one of the ten best Pokémon in the game as of 2010, stating that people "either love Gengar or hate it."[41] In a later reader-based poll, it placed ninth as one of the best ghost characters in a Nintendo game, which the magazine attributed to its design.[42] ONM also included it in its list of cool non-legendary Pokémon. Editor Thomas East noted it as a "cult favourite" of the ONM staff.[43] IGN called Gengar the best Ghost type Pokémon in Red and Blue, and also praised its appearance, citing a resemblance to Nekobus from My Neighbor Totoro.[44] Patricia Hernandez named Gengar her favourite from Pokémon Red and Blue.[45] IGN readers named it the 17th best Pokémon. Former IGN editor Audrey Drake called it a "pimp."[46] Game Informer called it the 32nd best Pokémon.[47] Game Revolution also included it in its list of the best Pokémon at 15.[48] Patricia Hernandez criticized its Mega form, despite her admiration for Gengar. She felt that it didn't get better, just weirder. She also felt that its rarer alternate colour was worse-looking than its normal form.[49] Its Mega form was ranked third in a poll of Japanese readers by Famitsu among other Mega forms.[50] Joshua Yehi of IGN included Gengar on 10 pokemon we want in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.[51]
