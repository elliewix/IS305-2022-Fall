Coalossal is a behemoth of a Pok√©mon, resembling a dinosaur such as a Tyrannosaurus rex or carnotaur. It is docile in nature, but when the coal mines that it calls home are vandalized, it will incinerate the offenders. When engaged in battle, the heap of coal on its back burns bright red as sparking cinders fly off of it. Gigantamax Coalossal raids are natively exclusive to Sword.
